This repository contains the necessary software elements to control the filling of a water storage tank in any type of home, everything will be controlled by means of a pic16f15244.
To make its correct development possible, it is necessary to have a series of elements such as an ultra-sound sensor, a source for a breadboard, an i2c which allows us to save considerable space when mounting, because for esteem and space reduction is the best. The respective programming is directly in assambler with an xc8 compiler and c ++ programming language.
Libraries of other pic were searched since with the present work it is a very recent pic and makes the resolution of this project more complicated. A number of records were modified.
Finally, it is expected that the ultrasound sensor calculates a prudent distance of 2cm to activate the led, which represents a buzzer and this generates an alarm notifying the user that it has already been filled.
